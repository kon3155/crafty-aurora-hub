I am a dual thoracic surgeon and tumor scientist, with research interests in clinical and basic research on lung cancer and other thoracic tumors. Thank you for taking an interest in our research. My primary appointment is within the Division of Thracic Surgery at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, and our research group can be found within the No.6 Building. Current research interests include microinvasive therapy and ERAS in thoracic surgery, comprehensive research and therapy in lung cancers, physical training before/after thoracic surgery as well. Our work requires the intersection and collaboration of multiple disciplines, including collaborations within Oncology, Pathology, Physiology, and Computer Sciences.<br/><br/>
I received my MD and Ph.D. degrees in Surgery from the China Medical University and completed my training as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Surgical Pathology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. My working experience is presented below:<br/>
